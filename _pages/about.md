Hi! Iâ€™m **Dongkuan Zhang**, a third-year Ph.D. student in **Environmental Science and Engineering**, jointly supervised by **Dalian University of Technology (DUT)** and **Science Tokyo (Institute of Science Tokyo)**.

I am currently based at **Science Tokyo**, in the **Department of Transdisciplinary Science and Engineering, School of Environment and Society**, where I work in the **Cross Laboratory** under the supervision of **Professor Jeffrey S. Cross** ([Lab website](https://zh.clab-tokyotech.org/)).
At **Dalian University of Technology**, I am advised by **Associate Professor Guozhao Ji** from the **School of Environmental Science and Technology** ([Profile](https://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/jiguozhao/zh_CN/index.htm)).

My research focuses on **multiphase flow CFD simulations**, **AI-driven modeling of multiphase systems**, and **waste incineration technologies**. Currently, I am developing intelligent multiphase flow models for the combustion of **distillation residues**, combining numerical simulation and artificial intelligence techniques.

I am passionate about bridging computational modeling and sustainable environmental technologies, aiming to contribute to cleaner and smarter industrial processes.
