Iâ€™m Dongkuan Zhang, a third-year Ph.D. student in Environmental Science and Engineering at Dalian University of Technology (DUT), supervised by Associate Professor Guozhao Ji ([Profile](https://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/jiguozhao/zh_CN/index.htm)).
As a joint Ph.D. student at the Institute of Science Tokyo, I am currently based in the Cross Laboratory, working with Professor Jeffrey S. Cross ([Lab website](https://zh.clab-tokyotech.org/)).

My research focuses on **multiphase flow CFD simulations**, **AI-driven modeling of multiphase systems**, and **waste incineration technologies**. Currently, I am developing intelligent multiphase flow models for the combustion of **distillation residues**, combining numerical simulation and artificial intelligence techniques.
