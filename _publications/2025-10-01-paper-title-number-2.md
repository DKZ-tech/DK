This review explores the integration of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to model multiphase flows and thermochemical systems, which are complex and computationally intensive. Traditional CFD methods face challenges like convergence issues and mesh sensitivity, while AI techniques such as deep learning (DL) and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer solutions by improving prediction accuracy and reducing computational costs. These AI methods can efficiently handle diverse flow regimes and enhance scalability, making them a promising tool for various applications, including chemical reactors, energy production, and environmental modeling. However, challenges remain in ensuring AI modelsâ€™ generalizability and physical consistency. My research focuses on developing more robust AI-CFD frameworks to overcome these obstacles and advance simulation capabilities.
