This study investigates the structural parameters of deep-sea mining vehicles, which impact both collection efficiency and environmental effects. By comparing experimental data from Belgium, South Korea, and China, the research identifies key parameters such as nodule size, nozzle diameter, jet angle, and suction speed. The study highlights the need for further optimization based on the specific characteristics of mining sites.
