To explore the disturbance of seabed sediments caused by the deep-sea polymetallic nodule mining process, experiments on the jet scouring of sediment pools by polymetallic nodule collection heads under different jet velocities, different depths from the bottom, and different traveling speeds were carried out to investigate the variation of gully depth and the migration and diffusion laws of sediments. The results show that the collection process of polymetallic nodules not only erodes sediment particles but also sediment blocks, resulting in an uneven surface of the gullies. After being disturbed, the sediment migrates and diffuses through the upper plume flow and the lower gravity flow.
