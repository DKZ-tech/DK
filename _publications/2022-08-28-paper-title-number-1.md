The deep sea contains rich mineral resources, with polymetallic nodules being a promising future metal source. Efficient and eco-friendly collection of these nodules from sediment is a key challenge. A hydraulic collection device with a dual-nozzle jet system has gained attention for its simple design, reliability, and low energy use. Using fluid simulation, this study analyzes the flow field of the collection head under different jet angles and suction speeds. The results indicate that optimal performance occurs with a 70Â° jet angle, front nozzle speed of 10 m/s, rear nozzle speed of 15 m/s, and a suction speed of 5 m/s.
