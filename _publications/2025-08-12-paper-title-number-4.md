Distillation residues are non-Newtonian fluids with shear-thinning behavior, where rheology impacts transport, handling, and disposal in waste management. Modeling viscosity-shear rate relations is difficult due to low precision and outlier sensitivity in varying shear conditions. Traditional models like power-law and Carreau, and ML methods such as linear regression and support vector regression, lack physical consistency and noise robustness from fixed structures or missing constraints. We present an Input Convex Neural Network (ICNN) enforcing convexity and monotonicity with non-negative weights and exponential mapping regularization for stable predictions, and compared to power-law, Carreau, linear regression, support vector regression, decision tree, random forest, and feedforward neural networks via MSE and RÂ². ICNN offers better accuracy with smooth curves, aiding residue conveyance optimization and nozzle blockage prevention in chemical engineering.
