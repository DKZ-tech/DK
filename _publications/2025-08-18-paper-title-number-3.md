This study investigated the gas-solid fluid dynamics and heat transfer in a lab-scale circulating fluidized bed (CFB) for the calcium looping process using the multiphase-particle-in-cell (MP-PIC) method. The focus was on particle residence time distribution (RTD) and solid back-mixing behavior under thermal and cold conditions. The results showed that the carbonator had a stable "core-annulus structure," while the regenerator exhibited irregular flow patterns due to gas-solid interactions and particle collisions, indicating flow heterogeneity. Thermal simulations revealed that high gas flow velocities led to particle accumulation and reverse flow in the regenerator. Uneven RTD profiles were observed, with some particles having extended residence times, contributing to back-mixing. Additionally, the regenerator reached the desired temperature, but the carbonator particles were 100â€“200 K cooler than the set reactor temperature due to insufficient residence time. These findings offer insights for optimizing the design and operation of CFB systems for calcium looping.
